      text: 'You wake up at the gates of a dungeon. The last thing you remember is that you were sailing when suddenly a dangerous storm occurred. The storm tore apart your ship and everything went black. Looking around the dungeon entrance you see a note left on the floor in front of you. You see some chains, bones, and weapons on the walls. There is also a door that is open and light floods out from it. Going through the door seems to be your only way forward as going out leads to the beach you arrived on. What do you want to do?',

The note reads “If it is freedom you seek then heed well my warnings. The left is filled with peril and it will fail you. Follow the right in the light and you will not fail. Stay on the right with the light and do not follow the darkness to the left.”',
